-- Functions names cannot begin with uppercase
-- functions without parameters = definition or name.

-- Lists
-- strings are lists

-- careful, haskell has to walk through the wall list to put something at the end
[1,2,3,9,0,7,6] ++ [400]
-- instantaneous:
0 : [1,2,3]
'A':" SMALL CAT"

-- : only at the beginning
1 : [2,3]
-- at the end
[1,2,3] ++ [4]

[1,2,3] is  syntactic sugar for 1:2:3:[]


-- take element at indexâ€¯.
